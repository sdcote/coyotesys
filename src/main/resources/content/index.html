                        <h4>Security</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability are built into each component and drive all design and technical decisions and approaches. Coyote DX was developed in the telecommunications and electric utility industries where security is of prime importance. NERC-CIP, NIST SP-800, NIST IR 7628, SOX, HIPPA, DHS Procurement Language all influenced DX design.</p>

								<h2>Device Convergence</h2>
								<p class="item-intro text-muted">Mediating the data models, communications protocols and operation activities of devices from many different vendors is challenging and complicated. Use device convergence to bring different devices from different vendors under one common model.</p>
								<img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/DeviceMediation.png" alt="">
								<p>Service providers find themselves with a variety of devices deployed in the field. Not only different devices, but different vendors and different versions and models from the same vendor. It seems every device has its own protocol, data model, API and exchange pattern. The challenge is how to represent the different devices and their data in one unified model.</p>
								<p>A successful approach is the use of device mediation components to abstract the vendor-specific details away from the system. CoyoteDX lives between the field devices and the data center, communicating with the devices in their own native protocols and transforming that data into one the rest of the organization understands. Data passes through the Perimeter Firewall with the devices native protocols but enters the Application Firewall using a single, uniform protocol thanks to the mediation of the CoyoteDX components.</p>
								<p>A group of workers running in the perimeter network receive jobs via work queues to poll devices in the field and each head-end system. The various forms of data are placed in a common data format and send to other message topics/queues for back office systems to receive and process. As the number of devices in the field increase, so to do the number of workers (and message queues/topics) to accommodate the load. Workers mediate between field devices and all the various protocols and the common unified model in the corporate data center or cloud infrastructure.</p>
								<p>Dedicated modules are written to interact with either the device directly or an intermediate (head-end) system and exchange data to the rest of the system using a common model. Voice and Data provisioning does not have to embed vendor-specific logic to interact with the hardware. Distribution management systems (DMS) can use IEC common information models (CIM) to interact with grid components using the device mediation modules as a facade to different hardware platforms.</p>
								<p>The result is vendor lock-in becomes a thing of the past, as CoyoteDX allows any equivalent device from any vendor to be deployed where appropriate and even replace existing devices from other vendors. You can implement Demand Management with devices from multiple vendors and let CoyoteDX handle protocol conversions. Grid Sensors from any vendor can be deployed without having to change any of the existing business logic. CoyoteDX ensures each vendor sends the same set of events and metrics so the back office can concentrate on just one model.</p>

								<h2>ITSM Integration</h2>
								<p class="item-intro text-muted">ServiceNow makes it easy to get data in, but getting your data out is a bit limited.</p>
								<img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/ITSMIntegration.png" alt="">
								<p>ServiceNow offers the MID server which is great for getting data into ServiceNow, but not so handy for getting it out. Sure, you can export CSV and a few other formats, but getting that data loaded into other systems is a bit "hit-or-miss" as not all systems deal with these formats very well. The result is usually a manually intensive process which prone to error and not very reliable. Even making web service calls from ServiceNow into other systems is difficult and requires configuration of not only ServiceNow, but networking (e.g. firewall routes) and the target system to support the ServiceNow call. The MID server is realistically only half of an integration solution and the rest of the options require a bit of work.</p>
								<p>It is also worth mentioning that many security groups have spoken up about placing an application in the data center under the direct control of an external system. Security audits have flagged this approach for closer scrutiny and suggest all communications are initiated and managed from within using tools under direct control of operations. Allowing an external agent or proxy behind the firewall such as the MID Server may violate security policies and require a more traditional integration approach.</p> 
								<p>Running CoyoteSN tools in CoyoteDX gives you the ability to implement bidirectional integrations with a few lines of a configuration file. You can make web service calls directly into the ServiceNow API and pull any data from any table and direct it to one or more target systems through not only flat files (CSV, XML and Fixed Field Length) but also through direct JDBC database and customized web service calls. You can even use other CoyoteDX modules to transform and write your ServiceNow data to other formats and systems.</p>
								<p>It is now possible to safely exchange data with external business partners without having them directly access your ServiceNow instance. Easily pull data from ServiceNow tables and format it to your business partner specifications and send it to them using their native protocols. They don't need to interface with ServiceNow at all. You can also query your external partner data using their API and protocols to create records for posting to your ServiceNow instance meeting the needs and specification of your table structures. Bidirectional business partner integrations to ServiceNow using one tool is simpler and more reliable than passing CSV files around.</p>
								<p>CoyoteSN allows you to implement integrations with ServiceNow in a few hours, not a few weeks (or months) and can be easily changed via configuration files which can be version controlled and managed by the operations staff. The developers only need to be involved when custom components are required.</p>

								<h2>Integrations As A Service</h2>
								<p class="item-intro text-muted">Run a pool of workers in your data center to scale integration horizontally.</p>
								<img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/CloudScale.png" alt="">
								<p>Coyote Systems runs multiple workers in our cloud-based data center to handle read-transform-write (RTW) processing which scales a s demand changes. Each worker retrieves a job assignment from the job queue, pulls the job configuration and context data from cloud storage, instantiates a transform engine, then runs the transform configuration. Pre and Post processing tasks ensure the environment are initialized and cleaned-up when the job is run ensuring each worker starts with a pristine environment with no data leakage.</p>
								<p>Data transfer jobs can be entered through the website or imported directly into the data store. These are the exact same jobs users created and ran locally; no modifications are required to run them in the cloud. This means each team can develop and debug their jobs locally and deploy them to the "cloud" when they are ready to productionalize their data transfers.</p>
								<p>You can run a similar configuration in your data center with your own infrastructure, use our cloud, or your own cloud infrastructure, Coyote is cloud-agnostic and portable across a variety of hosting environments. This means you can provide secure data mediation services to the entire organization with one solution. Each data transfer job can be owned and maintained by different people or centrally administered.</p>

								<h2>ITIL/ITSM Automation</h2>
								<p class="item-intro text-muted">If you have ServiceNow, CoyoteDX can operate as and agent for a wide variety of automation tasks.</p>
								<img class="img-responsive img-centered"
									src="img/portfolio/ITSMIntegration.png" alt="">
								<p>ServiceNow plug-ins can only take you so far. Sure, you can make web service calls out from business rules and scripts, but these facilities were never designed for heavy automation. What is often needed is an agent to be assigned work and have it perform all the complex processing. CoyoteDX can regularly query ServiceNow instances for work assigned to an individual or group, process it using purpose-written code to perform complex processing and update that ticket with the results.</p>
								<p>With CoyoteDX as an agent, ServiceNow can orchestrate any number of complex tasks in the enterprise. Once an incident or task is assigned to a pool of CoyoteDX agents, it can perform its work without having to embed business logic in the ServiceNow instance. An as a separate agent, CoyoteDX agent can run anywhere outside the ServiceNow instance on any platform and in any numbers necessary to support the workload. Too many provisioning tasks on Monday mornings? - Ramp up the number of CoyoteDX ServiceNow agents handling the increased workload. Another system needs to trigger the same processing? - Either have it open an task in ServiceNow or Have another CoyoteDX agent read from that other system for work assignments and perform the work in concert with ServiceNow assignments.</p>
								<p>CoyoteDX agents can also generate incidents in ServiceNow which allows any CoyoteDX process to report its status directly to ServiceNow for assignment to staff when processing notices exceptions or when resources are running low. Are there connection problems to a database required for an integration? CoyoteDX can open an incident so the issue can be resolved. A CoyoteDX agent may be tasked with scanning logs for patterns and opening an incident when patterns have been observed. Scanning LDAP logs for strange addresses or numerous failed authentications can trigger intrusion detection incidents. Scanning DHCP logs for suspicious activity can help detect foreign devices entering the network. The possibilities are limited only by your imagination.</p>
